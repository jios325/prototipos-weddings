# O Weddings by Oasis — Paginas Editoriales SEO (Sin Paquetes)

> **Estrategia:** Crear paginas de contenido editorial enfocadas en DESTINO, EXPERIENCIA y CONOCIMIENTO que posicionen para keywords de alto volumen de busqueda. Estas paginas NO mencionan paquetes directamente — venden Cancun como destino y O Weddings como la solucion. Inspiradas en la estrategia de Aman, Belmond y Four Seasons que Gemini identifico como "descomoditizacion del lujo nupcial".

> **Prerequisito:** Usa el mismo sistema de componentes de `OWeddings-ComponentSystem.md`

```

### Prompt de Refinamiento:
```
Make this feel like a Conde Nast Traveler or Aman editorial page. Increase whitespace generously (120px between sections). Use editorial drop caps on the intro paragraph. The image-text alternating blocks should feel like a magazine spread. Remove anything that feels "salesy" — this page builds trust through information, not through promotional language.
```

**Modelo inspirado en:** Four Seasons "What's Included" cards

### Prompt para Stitch:

```
Design a content page explaining the all-inclusive wedding concept for O Weddings by Oasis. The page should educate couples on WHY all-inclusive makes destination weddings easier, cheaper, and more enjoyable. Think informational and helpful — like a Four Seasons "experience" page.

COLORS: Navy #1B2A4A, Teal #2BBCC4, Sand #F5F0EB, White.
FONTS: Cormorant Garamond headings, Montserrat body.

SECTIONS:

1. NAVBAR.

- Card 3 — Icon: heart + dollar sign. Title: "For Your Budget." Body: "Destination weddings at all-inclusive resorts typically cost 40-60% less than equivalent celebrations at home. The average Cancun wedding for 30-50 guests costs $5,000-$8,500 USD — a fraction of the US average of $35,000."

4. COST COMPARISON VISUAL:
Sand background. Heading: "The Numbers Speak for Themselves"
Side-by-side visual comparison:
LEFT column: "Traditional US Wedding" — $35,000 average, venue rental, catering per plate, bar tab, separate lodging, vendor coordination, 12+ vendors to manage
RIGHT column: "All-Inclusive Cancun Wedding" — from $900 to $5,100, venue included with stay, catering included, bar included, guests stay at the venue, 1 dedicated coordinator, everything under one roof
Visual callout in center: "SAVE UP TO 60%"

5. WHAT'S INCLUDED breakdown:

Icon grid (5 columns x 4 rows) — similar to COMP-06 but with teal icons:

Row 2: Bridal bouquet with local flowers | Boutonniere for the groom | Sparkling wine toast | Wedding cake with natural flowers | Romantic room decoration
Row 3: Private dinner reception | Open bar (national beverages) | Elegant table setup | VIP check-in for couple | Room upgrade for couple

Small note: "Inclusions vary by celebration type. All four of our resorts are all-inclusive."

6. THE GUEST EXPERIENCE section:
Full-width image placeholder — resort pool area with beach in background, guests relaxing.
Overlay content box (white, positioned right):
- Heading: "While You Plan, They Vacation" in 28px Cormorant navy
- Body: "Your guests won't just attend a wedding — they'll enjoy an unforgettable Caribbean vacation. From gourmet buffets and specialty restaurants to beach lounging and pool parties, from live entertainment to world-class spas, every moment of their stay is included. All they need is their flight and a great outfit for your big day."
- List of guest inclusions: Unlimited meals at multiple restaurants | Open bar all day | Beach and pool access | Live nightly entertainment | Wi-Fi | Kids activities (at Grand Oasis Palm)

7. HOW IT WORKS timeline:
Clean horizontal timeline with 5 steps:
Step 1: "Contact Us" — Tell us your dream date and guest count
Step 2: "Choose Your Style" — We recommend the perfect resort and celebration type
Step 3: "Guests Book Rooms" — Your guests book their all-inclusive stay at group rates
Step 4: "We Handle Details" — Your coordinator plans every element
Step 5: "Celebrate" — Just show up and say "I do"

8. FAQ SECTION:
Accordion style:
- "Do my guests have to stay at the resort?" — For celebrations of 10+ guests, at least 80% must be hotel guests with all-inclusive plans. This ensures the best experience for everyone.
- "Can non-hotel guests attend?" — Yes, some celebration types allow non-hotel guests for an additional per-person fee.

## PAG-06: The Mayan Ceremony — Ancient Tradition Meets Modern Love

**URL:** `/mayan-ceremony`
**Keyword Principal:** mayan wedding ceremony mexico
**Keywords Secundarios:** mayan ceremony cancun, traditional mexican wedding ceremony, shaman wedding mexico, spiritual ceremony riviera maya
**Modelo:** Belmond storytelling + cultural editorial

### Prompt para Stitch:

```
Design an immersive editorial page about the Mayan Ceremony experience offered by O Weddings. This is cultural storytelling — think National Geographic meets luxury travel. The page should educate and inspire, evoking the spiritual depth and beauty of this ancient tradition.

COLORS: Navy #1B2A4A, Gold #C9A96E (primary accent for this page — representing ancient traditions), Teal #2BBCC4 (secondary), Deep earth green #2D5016 (nature), Sand #F5F0EB.
FONTS: Cormorant Garamond headings, Montserrat body.

SECTIONS:

1. NAVBAR.

2. HERO (90vh):

Center-aligned:
- "ANCIENT TRADITIONS" in 11px gold uppercase tracking
- "The Mayan Ceremony" in 56px Cormorant white
- "A sacred blessing from one of the world's oldest civilizations" in 18px white
- Thin gold ornamental divider

3. CULTURAL INTRO:
White background. Centered narrow column (max-width 650px).
Drop-cap opening paragraph:
"For over 3,000 years, the Maya civilization flourished across the Yucatan Peninsula — the very land where Cancun's turquoise waters meet white sand today. Their spiritual traditions, deeply connected to nature and the cosmos, have endured through centuries. When you choose a Mayan ceremony, you're not adding an 'exotic option' to your wedding — you're inviting an ancient culture to bless your union with rituals that honor the earth, the elements, and the eternal connection between two souls."

4. THE RITUAL section:
Alternating editorial blocks with earth-toned styling:

Block 1 — "The Shaman" (image left 50%, text right 50%):
- Image: close-up of Mayan shaman in traditional dress with feathered headdress
- Heading: "Guided by a Mayan Priest" in 28px Cormorant
- Body: "A J'men (Mayan priest or shaman) leads the ceremony in the ancient Mayan language, with a translation into Spanish. These spiritual leaders have inherited their knowledge through generations, serving as the bridge between the physical and spiritual worlds."

Block 2 — "The Elements" (text left, image right):
- Image: ceremony setup with copal incense, shells, flowers, candles on sand
- Heading: "Honoring the Four Elements"
- Body: "The ceremony invokes the four elements — fire (candles), water (the sea), earth (the sand), and wind (the Caribbean breeze) — asking each to bless and protect the couple's love. The smoke of copal tree incense purifies the ceremonial space, a tradition dating back to ancient temple rituals."

Block 3 — "The Blessing" (image left, text right):
- Image: couple kneeling with shaman performing blessing
- Heading: "Seven Spiritual Directions"
- Body: "The shaman seeks authorization from the Mayan gods, the four cardinal directions, the sky above, the earth below, and the center (the couple themselves) — the seven spiritual directions. This creates a sacred space where the union is witnessed not just by your guests, but by the forces of nature and the cosmos."

5. FULL-WIDTH QUOTE:
Earth-toned sand background. Large centered quote in 32px Cormorant italic gold: "In the Mayan tradition, love is not just between two people — it is a bond witnessed by the earth, the sky, and the ancient spirits of this land."
Attribution: "— Mayan ceremonial tradition" in 14px gray.

6. PRACTICAL DETAILS:
White background. Clean information:
- Duration: approximately 30-45 minutes
- Language: Performed in Mayan language, translated to Spanish (English translation available)
- Location: Beach or terrace at your resort
- Timing: Best at sunrise or sunset for the most powerful connection to nature
- Requirements: Arrive at least 2 business days before the ceremony
- Note: The Mayan ceremony is a spiritual/cultural experience, not legally binding. It can be combined with a symbolic or legal ceremony.

7. PRICING:
Simple, elegant:
- 2025: $820 USD
- 2026: $895 USD
- "The Mayan ceremony can be added to any O Weddings celebration."

8. CINEMATIC IMAGE BREAK:
Full-bleed panoramic image — wide shot of a Mayan ceremony on the beach at sunrise, smoke from copal rising into golden light.
